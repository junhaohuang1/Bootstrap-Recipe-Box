# Recipe-Box

A web site that uses the Spoonacular API to search for recipes and the Walmart API to lookup prices of the ingredients. Users can fill up a shopping basket to estimate the actual cost of making recipes. Initially built as a client side application with JavaScript, jQuery, and Google Firebase for storing favorite recipes. This app has been migrated to React.js.
